# Weather-Patterns-Plotting

This is a visualization to compare weather history in two cities of US. 

Two datasets have been used:

[KCQT - Los Angeles](https://github.com/Pariasrz/Weather-Patterns-Plotting/blob/main/KCQT.csv) 

[KNYC - New York](https://github.com/Pariasrz/Weather-Patterns-Plotting/blob/main/KNYC.csv)

Source :[https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/us-weather-history](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/us-weather-history)

First, daily maximum and minimum temperatures are plotted in each city. Then, the monthy mean of maximum temperatures and minimum temperature are calculated and plotted using bar plots. Therefore, we can compare mean temperatures in these cities. 

A scatterplot of precipitation can also be plotted.
